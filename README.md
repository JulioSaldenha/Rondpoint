# Rondpoint
A disjoint geometric font. I generate the OTF files from Fontforge. At the moment, the font does not have any special kerning features, and my punctuation marks need a lot to be desired.

I want to cover the entire Latin alphabet, and then we will see after that. Tests are compiled with XeTeX or LuaTeX.
